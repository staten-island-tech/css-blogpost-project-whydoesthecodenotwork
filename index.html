              This blog was infected with pink eye. Conjunctivitis, also known
              as pink eye, is inflammation of the outermost layer of the white
              part of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelid. It makes the
              eye appear pink or reddish. Pain, burning, scratchiness, or
              itchiness may occur. The affected eye may have increased tears or
              be "stuck shut" in the morning. Swelling of the white part of the
              eye may also occur. Itching is more common in cases due to
              allergies. Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.
